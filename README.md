# hasFHIR

Do not use.

The FHIR XSD to Haskell transformation works for XML serialization but the types are unwieldy. 
Transformation by xml-typelift package is better for the types but fails on Resource refs and restrictions on non-base types

I'm working on limited FHIR Resources with XML/JSON encoding/decoding 

Coming soon ...
